<p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was 
born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of 
mathematics, <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most 
prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <em>800 different books and</em> 
papers. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.
</p>

<p>He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's 
work, 
<cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)
</cite>, remained a standard textbook in the field for 
well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote 
Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772), 
<cite>giving a clear 
non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the 
time.
</cite>
</p>

<p>One can hardly write a mathematical equation without copying Euler. 
Notations still in use today, such as <var>e</var> and &pi;, were introduced 
in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind 
a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals 
of mathematics.

<h3>The Most Beautiful Theorem?</h3>

<p>Euler's Equation:</p>

	<p>cos(<var>x</var>) + <var>i</var>sin(<var>x</var>) =<var>e</var> (<var>i</var><var>x</var>)</p>

<p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex 
analysis, 
and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to
derive the identity
</p>

	<p><var>e</var><super>(&pi; <var>i</var>)</super> + 1 = 0</p>

<p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, pi, e, and i in a
single beautiful and elegant statement. A poll of readers 
conducted by 
<cite>
The Mathematical Intelligencer
</cite> magazine
named Euler's Identity as the most beautiful theorem in the
history of mathematics.
